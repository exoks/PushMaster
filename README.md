# push_swap #
The push_swap project involves creating an efficient sorting algorithm using a limited set of operations. The challenge is to sort a stack of integers with the fewest possible operations, including "push," "swap," and "rotate." This project focuses on algorithm optimization, stack manipulation, and solving complex problems with limited resources.
